I have 10+ years of **R programming** experience: Shiny apps, data analysis and visualization and also teaching.

I also use python mainly for machine learning and deep learning. I am using and learning **AWS** and **Docker** for private projects where I combine the use of **Python**, R and **PostgreSQL**.

I am passionate about free software and free culture. I have developed some R packages that are available to the community as well as Shiny applications using open data on various topics. Most of my projects are available on my **Github** account, follow me!
